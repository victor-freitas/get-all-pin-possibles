In this challenge is to write a function that transform a duration (given as a number of seconds) to readable text.
The function must accept a non-negative  integer. If its zero, it just returns ''now'', Otherwise, the duration is expressed as a combination of years, days, hours, minutes and seconds.
it is much easier to understand with an example:

* for seconds = 62, your function should return "1 minute and 2 seconds"

* for seconds = 3662, your funtion should return "1 hour, 1 minute and 2 seconds"
for the purpous of this challange, a year is 365 days, and a day is 24 hours.
